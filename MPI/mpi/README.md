MPI Examples
============

This is a set of MPI examples.
Listed below are the basic examples, which should be read through and attempted first.
There are [advanced examples](advanced/) covering more difficult—and perhaps less common—topics.

Basic Examples
--------------

- [example1](example1/):  "Hello, world" code for MPI.
- [example2](example2/):  First, point-to-point, message passing examples. An example of some deadlocking (blocking `MPI_Recv`) code is included.
- [example3](example3/):  Numerical integration examples, which highlight choice of cohort size.
- [example4](example4/):  Examples contrasting blocking and non-blocking function calls.
- [example5](example5/):  Communication pattern skeletons, including an example halo exchange.
- [example6](example6/):  Collective communication.
